# Beyond the Stars

Hello my fellow teammates and visitors from afar, 

We are aspiring writers, artists and programmers hoping to develop a solar system beyond our imagination, where you can explore the several planets, customize your space ship and find a place for you to call home. :globe_with_meridians:

We can't give you all the details yet- *(where is the fun in that lol)...*

However what we can say is you won't be disappointed! Althought my group and I aren't fully experienced in game development, we will bring our A game and finish this task!

Now let's introduce the team...

### Kathleen:
- Position: Desginer

### Gemma:
- Position: Scripter

### Julia:
- Position: Programmer

### Celara:
- Position: Scripter

### Sarah:
- Position: Programmer

And all of us together presents you our game: Beyond the Stars! 
Follow us on our journey as we take our first steps into the unknown.

Sincerely, <br>
Beyond the Stars :star2:
